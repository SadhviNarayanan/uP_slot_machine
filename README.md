# Final Project: Slot Machine (Sadhvi, Corey)

This repostitory contains all the source files for our final project - the Slot Machine.

This project implements a fully functional Slot Machine, that takes coins in a coin detector to input credits, allows for an adjustable wager amount for each round, and spins the reels and displays the player's payout and total credits.

The website for our project can be found here: [website](https://sadhvinarayanan.github.io/E155_Final_Project_Portfolio/).

All the FPGA code can be found within the fpga/src folder in this repo.

All the MCU source code files (e.g main) can be found within the mcu/src folder. 
All the MCU libraries can be found within the mcu/lib folder. 

All the sprite artwork can be found within the art/ folder.
